# Rock-Mod

**Rock-Mod** is a versatile and powerful framework designed for cross-platform mod development for Grand Theft Auto (GTA) servers. **VIMP** is the primary and recommended multiplayer platform; **RageMP**, **AltV**, and **Mock** are also supported, allowing you to build and manage mods seamlessly across these environments.

### Installation

To get started, simply install the package:

```bash
npm install rock-mod
```

### Usage

On the server-side, initialize Rock-Mod with the appropriate multiplayer type:

```typescript
const rockMod = await RockMod.create({
  multiplayer: "VIMP", // recommended; also supports "RageMP", "AltV", and "Mock"
});
```

### Multiplayer Types

Rock-Mod supports four multiplayer types:

1. **VIMP** - Primary and recommended platform for developing mods for VIMP servers
2. **RageMP** - For developing mods for RageMP servers
3. **AltV** - For developing mods for AltV servers
4. **Mock** - For testing and development without multiplayer dependencies

### Mock Mode

Mock mode provides a complete mock environment for testing your mods without requiring a multiplayer server. It includes:

- Full entity hierarchy (BaseObject, WorldObject, Entity)
- All entity types (Blip, Colshape, Marker, Object, Ped, Player, Vehicle)
- Type-safe events and RPC system
- In-memory state management
- Player connection simulation

Example using Mock mode for development:

```typescript
import { RockMod } from "rock-mod";

// Initialize in Mock mode
const rockMod = await RockMod.create({
  multiplayer: "Mock",
});

// Subscribe to events
rockMod.net.events.on({
  "rm::playerConnected": (player) => {
    console.log(`Player ${player.name} connected`);
  },
  "rm::playerDisconnected": (player) => {
    console.log(`Player ${player.name} disconnected`);
  },
});

// Register RPC handlers
rockMod.net.rpc.register("getPlayerInfo", (player) => {
  return {
    id: player.id,
    name: player.name,
    position: player.position,
  };
});
```

Example using Mock mode for testing:

```typescript
import { TestRockMod } from "rock-mod/testing";

// Initialize test environment
const rockMod = await TestRockMod.create({
  multiplayer: "Mock",
});

// Simulate player connection
const player = rockMod.simulatePlayerConnect({
  name: "TestPlayer",
  position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  health: 100,
});

// Test your mod logic here
// ...

// Simulate player disconnection
rockMod.simulatePlayerDisconnect(player);
```

### Features

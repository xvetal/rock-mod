# Rock-Mod

**Rock-Mod** is a versatile and powerful framework designed for cross-platform mod development for Grand Theft Auto (GTA) servers. **VIMP** is the primary and recommended multiplayer platform; **RageMP**, **AltV**, and **Mock** are also supported. **RockSandbox** wraps native server internal events; its other game APIs and client remain throwing stubs.

### Installation

To get started, simply install the package:

```bash
npm install rock-mod
```

To build this checkout locally, keep the compatible `rock-sandbox-types` checkout
beside `rock-mod`, then install dependencies and build:

```sh
npm --prefix ../rock-sandbox-types ci
npm ci
npm run build
```

The unpublished `@rock-sandbox/types` package is a development dependency through
`file:../rock-sandbox-types`. Its declarations are consumed directly; there is
no separate types build. The SDK imports named types from `/server` without
installing global RockSandbox declarations. The built SDK's public declarations
and JavaScript do not require this development package. Existing CI and release
automation need a follow-up change to provide the neighboring checkout.

### Usage

On the server-side, initialize Rock-Mod with the appropriate multiplayer type:

```typescript
const rockMod = await RockMod.create({
  multiplayer: "VIMP", // recommended; also supports "RageMP", "AltV", and "Mock"
});
```

### Multiplayer Types

Rock-Mod recognizes five multiplayer types:

1. **VIMP** - Primary and recommended platform for developing mods for VIMP servers
2. **RageMP** - For developing mods for RageMP servers
3. **AltV** - For developing mods for AltV servers
4. **Mock** - For testing and development without multiplayer dependencies
5. **RockSandbox** - Native server internal events; other game operations remain stubs

### RockSandbox scaffold

Select `RockSandbox` on the server:

```typescript
import { RockMod } from "rock-mod";

const rockMod = await RockMod.create({ multiplayer: "RockSandbox" });
```

On the client, import `RockMod` from `rock-mod/client` and use the same option.
Initialization requires no game runtime and creates explicit stub classes for all managers.
Structural components such as `net.events`, `net.rpc`, `net.dataHandler` (client only)
and entity manager iterators are accessible.

On the server, `net.events.onInternal`, `offInternal` and `emitInternal` delegate
to the native `rockSandbox.on`, `off` and `emit` API. Rock-mod has no separate
event registry or fallback implementation. These methods require the embedded
Rock Sandbox runtime; creation of RockMod itself still works without a host.
If the event API is missing, rebuild the server bundle in rock-sandbox:

```sh
python3 scripts/nodejs.py build
```

Delivery is synchronous, preserves argument references and registration order,
and propagates synchronous handler exceptions. Duplicate subscriptions are
independent; removal affects the last matching registration. Handler changes
during dispatch take effect on the next dispatch, including a nested one.
An event without listeners is valid.

This does not generate player or entity lifecycle events: their platform
integration is a later stage. Client events, RPC and game-state operations still
throw an `Error` identifying the platform, side, class and member:

```typescript
rockMod.world.setTimeHour(12);
// Error: [RockSandbox:server] RockSandboxWorldManager.setTimeHour: not implemented
```

Unimplemented methods returning `Promise` also throw synchronously when called.
The scaffold does not simulate game state or automatically subscribe to host
events during construction.

### Mock Mode

Mock mode provides a complete mock environment for testing your mods without requiring a multiplayer server. It includes:

- Full entity hierarchy (BaseObject, WorldObject, Entity)
- All entity types (Blip, Colshape, Marker, Object, Ped, Player, Vehicle)
- Type-safe events and RPC system
- In-memory state management
- Player connection simulation

Example using Mock mode for development:

```typescript
import { RockMod } from "rock-mod";

// Initialize in Mock mode
const rockMod = await RockMod.create({
  multiplayer: "Mock",
});

// Subscribe to events
rockMod.net.events.on({
  "rm::playerConnected": (player) => {
    console.log(`Player ${player.name} connected`);
  },
  "rm::playerDisconnected": (player) => {
    console.log(`Player ${player.name} disconnected`);
  },
});

// Register RPC handlers
rockMod.net.rpc.register("getPlayerInfo", (player) => {
  return {
    id: player.id,
    name: player.name,
    position: player.position,
  };
});
```

Example using Mock mode for testing:

```typescript
import { TestRockMod } from "rock-mod/testing";

// Initialize test environment
const rockMod = await TestRockMod.create({
  multiplayer: "Mock",
});

// Simulate player connection
const player = rockMod.simulatePlayerConnect({
  name: "TestPlayer",
  position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  health: 100,
});

// Test your mod logic here
// ...

// Simulate player disconnection
rockMod.simulatePlayerDisconnect(player);
```

### Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Write once, run on any supported platform
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Entity Management**: Unified API for managing game entities
- **Networking**: Type-safe events and RPC system
- **Testing**: Dedicated testing API through `rock-mod/testing`
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize

### Documentation

Client-side implementations are available for RageMP and VIMP. RockSandbox has
native server internal events and otherwise throwing client/server stubs; AltV
and Mock remain server-only.

Rock-Mod simplifies multiplayer mod development by providing unified tools for managing game entities, networking, and more across different platforms.
